/**
 * FUNCTIONS E10: More practice
 * =====================================================================================
 * @task
 * Declare an interface of any name with 1 item of 'age' of type 'number'
 * Create a function that works as follows:
 * * The function name is 'personAge' strictly.
 * * The function takes an object of any number of key-values, (the 'age' must be presented) as an argument
 * * The function returns the value of 'age'
 * * Argument type must be annotated, whatever way you prefer (as a type Alias or as the inline type)
 * * You can use any type of function syntax!
 * Example: personAge({ id: 1, age: 23 }) => 23;
 * Example: personAge({ name: 'Kevin', age: 41 }) => 41;
 * !!! The function must be exported !!!

// Your code goes here...

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-10"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
