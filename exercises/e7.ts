/**
 * FUNCTIONS E7: Early return
 * =====================================================================================
 * @task
 * Create a function that works as follows:
 * * The function name is 'doesArrayIncludeItemsBetweenVals'
 * * The function take an object as the argument
 * * The object contains the following key-value pairs:
 * * * arr (array),
 * * * val1 (number),
 * * * val2 (number).
 * * The function returns a boolean if array includes an item that is greater than val1 and less than val2
 * * The function MUST have 2 return statements: make an early return if the item is found and use the default return otherwise
 * * You can either destructure the argument right away or onside of the function
 * * The argument type must be annotated
 * * You can NOT use Type Alias in this exercise!
 * * You can use any type of function syntax!
 * Example: doesArrayIncludeItemsBetweenVals([2, 4, 2], 3, 5) => true
 * Example: doesArrayIncludeItemsBetweenVals([2, 4, 2], 5, 10) => false
 * !!! The function must be exported !!!
 */

// Your code goes here...


export function doesArrayIncludeItemsBetweenVals({arr, val1, val2}: {arr: [], val1: number, val2: number}): boolean {
  let result: boolean = false
  for (let i: number = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if ( arr[i] > val1 && arr[i] < val2) {
      result = true
    }
  }  
  return result
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-7"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
